Design solution 1 - Inventory Management code

1.  Code is runable in with Java 8 compiler from TestInventoryService.java class
2.  Inventory items and operations is done on java cache. We can extend this to File or DB resource for storage of Inventory data
3.  In this project we are calling InventoryServiceInterface via TestInvertoryService. We can extend to REST based API which will be invoked by any thin client like mobile or any other device
4.  We can Spring based container to inject dependency services at runtime
5.  I am doing basic Exception Handling and Validation and sending Error messages to TestInventoryService Client
